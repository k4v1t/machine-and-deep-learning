\section{Pick 5 of your favourite datasets}
I have picked the following 5 datasets for this week's project: \\
1. Adult Income or Census Income from US Census Bureau: \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult}{\underline{Adult Income}} \\
2. Air Quality or AirQualityUCI using sensors in Italy: \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality}{\underline{Air Quality}} \\
3. Micro Gas Turbine Electrical Energy Prediction: \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/994/micro+gas+turbine+electrical+energy+prediction}{\underline{Electrical Energy Prediction}} \\
4. Heart Disease (Cleveland): \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease}{\underline{Heart Disease}} \\
5. Wine Quality (Red and White Vino Verde): \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality}{\underline{Wine Quality}} 

\section{How many data points or instances in each dataset?}
1. The adult income dataset has \textbf{48,842} instances, split across train and test data \\
2. The air quality dataset has \textbf{9,358} instances \\
3. The electrical energy prediction dataset has \textbf{71,225} instances \\
4. The heart disease dataset has \textbf{303} instances \\
5. The wine quality dataset is \textbf{1,599 red wine} and \textbf{4,898 white wine} instances

\section{How many features in each dataset?}
1. The adult income dataset has \textbf{14} features (attributes per person) \\
2. The air quality dataset has \textbf{15} features (readings from sensors) \\
3. The electrical energy prediction dataset has \textbf{1} feature (time series) \\
4. The heart disease dataset has \textbf{13} features (patient attributes) \\
5. The wine quality dataset has \textbf{11} features (chemical test information)

\section{What type of person might have collected this data?}
1. The adult income dataset would be collected by a \textbf{census bureau} \\
2. The air quality dataset would have been collected by a \textbf{government or environmental agency} \\
3. The electrical energy prediction dataset would have been collected by an \textbf{energy department} \\
4. The heart disease dataset would have been collected by a \textbf{medical institute} \\
5. The wine quality dataset would have been collected by a \textbf{wine producer}

\section{Why do I find each of the datasets interesting?}
1. Adult Income: It would be interesting to see how well demographics can predict income \\
2. Air Quality: I'm interested in understanding how certain attributes can determine extent of air pollution \\
3. Electrical Energy: I find time series analysis quite interesting, and this seemed quite realistic \\
4. Heart Disease: Understanding the effect of someone's attributes on heart disease can have very positive health impact \\
5. Wine Quality: \textbf{I love wine!}

\section{What are some deeper insights the datasets might reveal?}
